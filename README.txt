# YOUR PROJECT TITLE : StoreMain (Product Management System designed for small businesses or individual sellers)


 

#### Description:
  Product Management System designed for small businesses or individual sellers.
It allows a store owner (Manager) to register, log in, and manage their products through an intuitive interface.

In the Manager Page, the user can:

➕ Add new products to the database

✏️ Edit existing product details

❌ Delete unwanted products

Each manager also has a Profile Page that contains a unique shareable link.
When this link is shared with customers, they can view all the products associated with that specific manager — without needing to log in — making it easy to browse and explore available items.

The project uses a modern full-stack architecture built with the following technologies:

Pug – for dynamic templating

Tailwind CSS + CSS – for a clean, responsive, and modern design

JavaScript & TypeScript – for type-safe and efficient front-end and back-end logic

Express.js – as the main backend framework

PostgreSQL – as a relational database storing users, products, and their relationships (users, products, join_products)

JWT + Cookies – for secure authentication and session management

This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful way to manage products, combining a user-friendly interface for managers with a smooth viewing experience for customers.
